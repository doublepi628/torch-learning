## Introduction

Since joining the research group, I have needed to learn some knowledge about deep learning and the corresponding code implementation. In addition, the artificial intelligence course offered in the second semester of my sophomore year also requires us to quickly learn relevant content. Therefore, I started self-learning and recorded my notes in this repository.
